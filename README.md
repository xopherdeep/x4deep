# Xengine is Small and PowerFull; Hook into it using Xtras. The Xengine Idea is: Drop and Build!
# It setups an easy to use connection between Clean URLs and PHP Classes
# The eXtend PHP Classes with Xengine allowing Easy Access to the the DB using $q = $this->q(); 
# The DB doesn't connect until the function is called, once connected, it can be accessed via $this->Q
# The CleanURL Structure is as Follows: domain.com/class/method/param1/param2/param3/etc
# where class is the class name found in the Xtra's. ex: xClass.php, the method should be found there.
# If there is an HTML page to render with the method, the files go in the html dir,
